# cross-section-plot
Plot the neutron cross-sections as function of the incident energy.

The data are from ENDF and are collected from the IAEA website.

I downloaded the evaluated (or interpolated or tabulated) data, at 293K.

The data in endf file are at 0K and does not give the desired result (misc folder).

- Lib: Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF)/B-VIII.0 (USA,2018)

- The data are download using `See: plotted data` button at the right of the page.
